  abstract = {This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential equations (PDE). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, a significantly expanded bibliography. About the First Edition: I have used this book for both regular PDE and topics courses. It has a wonderful combination of insight and technical detail. … Evans\&\#39; book is evidence of his mastering of the field and the clarity of presentation. —Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas It is fun to teach from Evans\&\#39; book. It explains many of the essential ideas and techniques of partial differential equations … Every graduate student in analysis should read it. —David Jerison, MIT I usePartial Differential Equationsto prepare my students for their Topic exam, which is a requirement before starting working on their dissertation. The book provides an excellent account of PDE\&\#39;s … I am very happy with the preparation it provides my students. —Carlos Kenig, University of Chicago Evans\&\#39; book has already attained the status of a classic. It is a clear choice for students just learning the subject, as well as for experts who wish to broaden their knowledge … An outstanding reference for many aspects of the field. —Rafe Mazzeo, Stanford University},
